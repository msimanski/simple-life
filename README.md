# simple-life
A simple cellular life simulator written in Java for a project.
Places random still-life cells on the board.
If two stills overlap they explode and eat all the others as food.
It's not effeciently coded (relies too much on static) because I wanted to get it done as fast as possible (school deadline).
The pause button (spacebar) works on Linux, but not on Win-blows. I could rewrite it to use a KeyBinding, but I dont think that would be necessary and/or not a waste of my time.
